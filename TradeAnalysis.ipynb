    "# 2.0 Project Inspiration\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was inspired by the stock market crash of March 2020 and intended to be used as a comprehensive system to trade stocks and make money.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bulls or people confident in the market lost a lot of money in March 2020 crash. However, the bears or the people betting against the market made a fortune. Within a few weeks, the market started its uptrend again and reached an all-time high within few months from nearly 50% down.  The rapid decline and rise in the market provided a tremendous opportunity for profit and served as a very inspirational moment. Instead of making money only once, depending on whether I was a bull or bear, I wanted to make money all the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Trading stocks is a losing game for most people: 90% of traders lose money, and only 10% make money consistently. From my research and experience in the stock market, some of the best predictors for success in trading are managing emotions, processing information quickly to see patterns before others, and executing fast. Thus, I embarked on a journey to create a trading bot that would be able to do all of this better than I ever could. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project looks at a relatively simple trading bot that will serve as the building block of a comprehensive trading system. This bot uses two out of 6 algorithms from Investopedia's day trading course. The other four algorithms were not precise, and I wanted a working bot released as quickly as possible for testing and optimization purposes. The bot trades Apple's stock only and also operates under an ideal condition, which simplified the buying and selling process of stocks. With all that said, let's see how the trading bot does with an initial balance of USD 10,000"

    "## 3.1 Investing vs. Day Trading and Short vs. Long Position\n",
    "\n",
    "When buying a particular stock, knowledgable investors typically use a combination of the company's fundamentals, stock's price chart, and related news to determine whether to go long on a stock or short it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an investor is confident that stock's price will increase, he buys the stock and profits when the stock's price rises. In trading terminologies, this is going on long on a stock. On the other hand, if an investor expects a stock's price to go down, he would short the stock. Shorting a stock means that he loans shares and sells it in the open market with the hope that he can buy and return the shares back to the owner at a lower price. There are other securities that traders can trade which are out of scope for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "A trader typically holds a stock for a much shorter period than an investor. A day trader would close off his positions at the end of the business day. The rationale behind this is to help him mentally check out and start fresh the following day. Also, a day trader only looks at the stock's price chart to make trading decisions.  This trading bot day trades. So all of the positions are closed at the end of the day, and only the stock's price chart is used to make trading decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2 Different Type of Orders\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplification, the different types of orders when buying stocks using a broker will be explained from the perspective of an investor intending to go long on a stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "When buying shares, the buyer can specify a market order or limit order. A market order will instruct the broker's bot to purchase shares at the best current price; this price is usually very close or the same as the current stock's price shown by the broker. For a limit order, the buyer specifies what price he wishes to buy a specific number of shares; this price is called the limit price and is usually lower than the current stock's price.\n",
    "\n",
    "When selling shares, the buyer can specify a market order, limit order, or stop-loss order. Just like with buying shares, a market order will instruct the broker's bot to sell the specified number of shares asap at the best possible price. For a limit order, the buyer specifies what price he wishes to sell a specific number of shares; this price is called the limit price, and this price is typically equal to or above the stock's current price. For a stop-loss order, the seller specifies the stop-loss price which if the stock price hits, the bots are to sell a specified number of shares automatically at the limit price or higher; the limit price and stop-loss price could be the same; both are usually below the current stock price.\n",
    "\n",
    "For shorting a stock, buying would imply loaning shares and selling on the market, and selling would mean buying shares back from the open market to return to the owner. All the trade algorithms here utilizes market order when buying.  For every purchase order, two other orders are specified for selling the position. The first order for selling is a limit sell order, and the second order is a stop-loss order. A profitable trade would be closed by a limit sell, and unprofitable trade would be closed by a stop-loss sell. For going long on a stock, the limit price for selling would be set higher than the purchase price, and the stop-loss price for selling would be set lower than the purchase price. For shorting a stock, the limit price for selling would be set lower than the purchase price, and the stop-loss price for selling would be set higher than the purchase price.\n",

    "## 3.3 Explanation of Derived Numbers and Their Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The following numbers are calculated from stock's data: SMA, EMA, RSI\n",
    "\n",
    "SMA stands for simple moving average. When calculating SMA, the time unit and time interval need to be specified. For example, calculating SMA for a period of 9 and a time unit of minutes would involve taking the closing price of a stock for the last 9 minutes and taking the average. SMA9 could denote this average for short. EMA stands for exponential moving average. The idea to calculate EMA is similar to that of SMA, but EMA gives more weight to recent data, unlike SMA, which gives equal weight to all the data. The bot utilizes EMA and SMA over 9, 15, 65, and 200-minute intervals are designated by SMA9, SMA15, SMA65, SMA200 or EMA9, EMA15, EMA65, EMA200\n",
    "\n",
    "RSI stands for relative strength index. Mathematically, RSI looks at average gain vs. average loss over a specific period; 14 minutes in this case. RSI ranges from 0 to 100. RSI of 30 or below indicates that the stock is oversold while RSI of 70 or above shows an overbought condition. RSI should not be used on its own to sell or buy stocks as stocks can stay overbought or oversold for a long time.\n",

    "The two trading algorithms the bot uses are Base Trade Algorithm and Far From Moving Average Trade Algorithm. The specific implementation of the trades can be studied from the code included in the repository. The basic theory of the algorithms are described below\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1 Base Trade Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The base trade algorithm first ensures that a stock is in a \"Base\"; the stock's price should appear virtually flat for a minimum of 30 minutes. More specifically, the price should fluctuate no more than 0.5% of the stock's price. As soon as the stock's price moves out of the 0.5% range in either direction, place a market order for going long or short. The stop loss price is equal to the lowest/highest price during the base. Depending on the stock's price, the limit sell price is specified to reach a profit target of \\\\$0.25-\\\\$1 per share.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.2 Far From Moving Average Trade Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Far from moving average trade algorithm first ensures that the stock has diverted more than $1.50 from the closest EMA and RSI is <=20 or >=80. When the stock's price starts to break its upward or downward spiral, place a market order for going short or long. The stop-loss order is placed on the lowest/highest point of the spiral, and the limit sell order should be specified to reach a target of no more than \\\\$1 profit per share."

The limit sell price is set at \\\\$274 per share.  Within thirty seconds, the stock's price reached the price target of \\\\$274 per share. At 1:32 PM, the bot receives data up to the end of 1:31 PM. The bot sees that the stock's price closed at \\\\$275 at the end of 1:31 PM.

    "# 7.0 Future Goals and Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of more near term improvements, I would like to repeat the same experiment over a couple of years for more conclusive ideas. I would also like to implement a smart stop loss, so the bot does not close a winning trade as soon as it reaches a fixed profit target. It should instead keep the trade alive and implement a rising stop-loss to preserve gains. Experimenting with stop-loss price and limit sell price is another option for a long list of things to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The future goals and improvements for this project are massive. I intend to build a comprehensive trading system that utilizes a company’s fundamentals, news, and price chart to make trading decisions. Also, I want the trading system to trade other securities as well, such as options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the infrastructure is up, more focus can be made on testing different trading algorithms on a vast amount of data. The algorithms need to be run on stocks with varying prices, volumes, and exchanges. Also, the market behaves distinctly differently during economic prosperity vs. time of economic downturn and everything else in the middle. Stock’s performances are also affected by long term technological trends, geopolitical environments, and so on. Thus, the scope of testing is enormous. Ideally, the purpose of running all this test would be to calculate the probability of a trade being profitable very precisely. The bot could then only act on the trading signals that are most likely going to result in a profitable trade. All of this infrastructure building will require a massive upgrade in the software architecture with a high degree of focus on speed of analysis so trades can be made on time. After all, there is no point in building a sophisticated system that can predict a profitable trade after the time to execute has passed."

    "# 8.0 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project looked at the result of a bot trading Apple’s stock (Ticker: AAPL) only for 19 business days with a starting capital of USD 10,000 between March 10, 2020, to April 3, 2020. The bot used the base trade algorithm and the far from moving average trade algorithm to make trading decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of April 3, 2020, the account balance was \\\\$9923.26, a loss of \\\\$76.74. The total number of trades made was 186. The number of winning and losing trades was the same (93). However, the bot had more massive losses than gains. Far from moving, average trade lost a net \\\\$-89.24 while base trade won a net \\\\$12.50 over the simulation period. The best type of trade was shorting a stock from a base trade signal with a net profit of \\\\$71.50 over the simulation period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis looked at a couple of variables to see if they provide any insight between winning and losing days/trades. The buy time of the trade does not predict whether a trade will be profitable or not. The stock’s price range and standard deviation in a given day also do not provide any insight on a day being profitable or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediate improvements for this project include implementing a smart stop loss and fine-tuning the stop loss and limit sell price based on running the same experiment over long timeframes. The ultimate future goal is to create a comprehensive trading system that uses a company’s fundamentals, news, stock’s price chart, and underlying economic metrics to make trading decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this bot and project will serve as a good building block for a comprehensive trading system, and none of the results can be deemed conclusive because of the small sample size. "
